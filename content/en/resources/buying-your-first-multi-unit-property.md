Everything you need to know about investing in small rental buildings — the mindful way.

For many aspiring homeowners and investors in Toronto, the dream isn’t just about owning property — it’s about creating financial freedom, building community, and doing it in a way that aligns with your values.

That’s where multi-unit properties come in.

Buying your first fourplex or other 4–10 unit residential building is one of the smartest — yet most misunderstood — paths to financial growth. As both a heart-centered financial coach and a licensed Mortgage Agent, I specialize in guiding first-time buyers through this unique journey. And as an immigrant myself, I’m especially passionate about helping newcomers and everyday Canadians access wealth-building tools that were once reserved for the few.

If you’ve been thinking about owning a small rental building, this guide is for you.

## Why Multi-Unit Properties Are Toronto’s Hidden Gem

While the headlines often focus on condos or single-family homes, the real opportunity lies in Toronto’s “missing middle” — multi-unit buildings that offer:

✅ Rental income to offset your mortgage  
✅ House hacking (live in one unit, rent out the others)  
✅ Long-term appreciation in a growing city  
✅ More affordability per unit than buying several homes  
✅ Community impact by offering fair housing to local families

In Ontario, buildings with up to 6 units often qualify for residential financing — making them easier to access than commercial real estate.

## 1. Start with a Clear, Holistic Vision

Buying a fourplex or similar property isn’t just about returns — it’s about lifestyle, growth, and alignment. Before looking at listings, ask yourself:

- Do I want to live in one unit and rent the rest, or rent all units?
- Am I comfortable being a landlord, or do I want support managing tenants?
- How does this investment fit into my life goals — freedom, family, impact?

💡 *Tip: When your investment reflects your personal values, you’re more likely to succeed long-term.*

Multi-unit investing takes planning — but with the right guidance, it becomes empowering.

As your coach and mortgage agent, I help you:

📊 Understand your budget and cash flow  
💳 Improve your credit profile for better rates  
🧾 Plan for down payments (typically 20–25%)  
🛠️ Prepare for maintenance and vacancy reserves

Whether you’re employed, self-employed, or new to Canada, we’ll build a financial plan that works for your real life.

## 3. Understand the Mortgage Process

As a Mortgage Agent Level 2, I work with a wide network of lenders — from banks to private options — to find the right mortgage for your property and vision.

Together, we will:

✔️ Get pre-approved confidently  
✔️ Compare rates and loan terms  
✔️ Navigate documents, insurance, appraisals, and closing  
✔️ Create a sustainable cash flow plan for your new property

Throughout it all, I explain everything in plain, clear language — and in English or Spanish.
