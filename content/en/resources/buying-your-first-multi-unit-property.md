I’m Fanny — a heart-centered financial coach and licensed Mortgage Agent (Level 2) in Toronto. Many clients I work with are professionals or families seeking to expand into small apartment buildings (4–10 units) as part of their wealth strategy.

This guide gives you practical steps, clean math, and safe conditions so you can move confidently from “curious” to “owner.”

> My approach: numbers + nervous-system calm. Decisions that fit your life — not someone else’s spreadsheet.

## Quick Check (60 Seconds Before Falling in Love)

**Core Formulas:**
- **GMR:** total rent from all units  
- **OPEX:** taxes, insurance, utilities you pay, maintenance, lawn/snow, garbage, mgmt fees (estimate **35–45% of GMR** if unknown)  
- **NOI:** GMR − OPEX  
- **ADS:** annual debt service = mortgage payment × 12  
- **Cash Flow:** NOI − ADS (build a cushion)  
- **DSCR:** NOI ÷ ADS → target **≥ 1.20**  
- **Cap Rate:** (NOI ÷ Price) × 100

If DSCR < 1.0 or cash flow is negative, pause and renegotiate or revisit expenses.

## 1) Choose Your Investment Strategy

House-hack (live in one unit), pure investment (rent all), or stabilize & improve (safety/systems).  
If you value flexibility and learning, house-hack; if you want separation, budget for management.

## 2) Build Your Financing Plan

Typical down payment: **20–25%**. Lenders stress-test rates.  
**Pre-approval checklist:** ID/SIN, income proof, down payment & closing cost proof, existing debts/taxes, draft rent roll with utility responsibilities. I’ll match you to the right lender and walk you from appraisal to close.

## 3) Analyze the Building (Before You Offer)

Request **rent roll**, **12-month income/expense**, **fire/electrical reports**, **insurance declaration**, **service contracts**.

**Example:** 6 units @ $1,950 → **GMR $11,700/mo**; **OPEX @ 40% = $4,680/mo**; **NOI $7,020/mo ($84,240/yr)**; Price **$1.45M → Cap ≈ 5.8%**; **ADS ≈ $70k/yr → DSCR 1.20**; **Cash Flow ≈ $14,240/yr (~$198/unit/mo)**.  
If tight, negotiate price/vendor credits or reduce OPEX (separate hydro, efficiency upgrades).

## 4) Write a Safe Offer (Conditions Protect You)

Include **financing**, **inspection**, **review of leases/estoppel**, **insurance quote**, and **fire code/zoning comfort letters**.

Email script to your agent:  
> “We’d like to submit $___ subject to financing, inspection, review of leases/estoppel, and insurance. Please request utility/property-tax statements and recent fire/electrical reports. We’re aiming for a smooth, professional close.”

## 5) First 90 Days as a Landlord

**Pre-closing:** lawyer, insurance, utilities, maintenance.  
**Days 1–7:** tenant intro letter; confirm rent payment, rules, emergency contact.  
**Days 8–30:** safety upgrades; bookkeeping system.  
**Days 31–90:** plan capital repairs; build a **3–6 month** reserve.

**Welcome Note (sample):**  
> “Hi, I’m Fanny (or your property manager). We value safe, respectful housing. Repairs: text/email ___. Emergencies: call ___. Rent due on __. Thank you for being part of this community.”

## Risks & Mitigations

Vacancy (keep **1 month/unit** in reserve; market early), unexpected repairs (prioritize safety + maintenance calendar), rate changes (underwrite conservatively; accelerate principal when rates dip).
