Debt is one of the most common financial challenges Canadians face. Credit cards, student loans, car loans, and lines of credit can pile up, leaving many people feeling stressed, ashamed, or stuck.  

Here’s the truth: **debt is not a personal failure.** It’s simply a situation that needs clarity, structure, and a calm plan.  

As a **Holistic Financial Coach and Mortgage Agent Level 2** in Toronto, I guide families and professionals through debt repayment strategies that build confidence — without losing peace of mind.

## Step 1: Reframe the Story

- Debt is common — more than half of Canadians carry it.  
- What matters isn’t the past, but the plan you create moving forward.  
- Replace shame with clarity: you are not your debt.  

---

## Step 2: Know Your Debt Picture

- List every balance, interest rate, and minimum payment.  
- Identify which debts feel urgent (emotionally) and which cost the most (mathematically).  
- Use the **Debt Snowball Tool** at [/en/tools](/en/tools) to visualize your payoff plan.  

---

## Step 3: Choose Your Repayment Strategy

- **Snowball method:** Pay off the smallest balance first for a quick win → builds momentum.  
- **Avalanche method:** Pay off the highest-interest balance first → saves the most money long term.  
- **Hybrid:** Combine both — target a debt that is both small *and* high-interest for faster relief.  

---

## Step 4: Consider Consolidation & Refinancing

- A **consolidation loan** can simplify multiple debts into one lower-rate payment.  
- A **mortgage refinance** can reduce interest costs — but only if paired with healthy cash flow habits.  
- Guardrail: Don’t roll high-interest debt into your mortgage unless you have a clear plan to prevent rebuilding debt.  

---

## Step 5: Holistic & Emotional Lens

- Debt often carries emotional weight — stress, shame, or avoidance.  
- Create **calm routines**: weekly 15-min “money dates” to check progress.  
- Celebrate small wins: every payment is progress.  
- 💡 *Human Design lens:* Emotional Authority? Avoid committing to consolidation under pressure — wait for clarity.  

---

## Step 6: Case Study

**Scenario:** A Toronto professional with $18,000 in credit card debt at 19% interest.  
- Consolidated into a 9% personal loan.  
- Saved $300/month in interest.  
- Built a realistic 4-year payoff plan.  
- Result: Lower stress, higher cash flow, and steady progress.

## ✅ Quick Debt Reset Checklist

- [ ] Write down balances and interest rates  
- [ ] Choose snowball, avalanche, or hybrid strategy  
- [ ] Automate extra payments toward your target account  
- [ ] Explore consolidation or refinancing if it lowers stress & cost  
- [ ] Celebrate progress monthly — no win is too small
