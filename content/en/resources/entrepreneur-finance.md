## Why Entrepreneur Money Feels Different

- Income is variable, not fixed.  
- Youâ€™re responsible for both earning and managing.  
- Freedom brings opportunity â€” and pressure.  

The solution: simple, repeatable systems that protect your time and energy.

## Step 1: Core Setup Every Entrepreneur Needs

- **Three accounts:**  
  1. **Income** (all deposits)  
  2. **Operating** (business expenses)  
  3. **Tax Reserve** (set aside 25â€“30%)  

- Automate transfers: every deposit â†’ move a % into Tax Reserve.  
- Pay yourself regularly (weekly or biweekly) to create stability.

## Step 2: Manage Cash Flow Calmly

- **Weekly money date (15 min):** record income, track expenses, check reserves.  
- **Monthly review (30â€“45 min):** reconcile accounts, adjust pricing or set-asides.  
- Use tools like the **Holistic Budget Calculator** and **Cash Flow Tracker** at [/en/tools](/en/tools).

## Step 3: Taxes & Business Structure

- **Sole proprietorship vs. incorporation:** Incorporate when income exceeds what you need personally or for liability/tax reasons.  
- **HST/GST registration:** required when revenue exceeds $30,000 in 4 consecutive quarters.  
- **Deductible expenses:** home office, vehicle, software, marketing, insurance, coaching, professional fees.  

ðŸ’¡ Keep business and personal expenses separate for clarity and audit protection.

## Step 4: Build Safety Nets

- **Personal reserve:** 3â€“6 months of essentials.  
- **Business reserve:** 1â€“2 months of operating costs.  
- Insurance: disability, critical illness, or health coverage if not provided elsewhere.

## Step 5: The Holistic & Emotional Lens

Entrepreneurship is not just numbers â€” itâ€™s identity, stress, and freedom.  

- Separate your **self-worth from business income**.  
- Build rhythms that support both cash flow and wellbeing.  
- *Optional Human Design lens:* Different types thrive with different work rhythms â€” honor your natural energy.
