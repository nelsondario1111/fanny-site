Building wealth is like playing offense — but true financial stability also requires defense. That’s where **insurance and safety nets** come in.  

For many families, insurance feels confusing or fear-based. But when approached with clarity and compassion, it’s simply about **protecting your loved ones and creating peace of mind**.  

As a **Holistic Financial Coach and Mortgage Agent Level 2** in Toronto, I help families choose protection that fits their life, not just a policy. Here’s what you need to know.

## Why Protection Matters

- Without a safety net, emergencies can undo years of careful planning.  
- Insurance is less about cost, and more about **freedom and security** for your family.  
- Holistic protection balances growth and defense — so your money works without fear.  

---

## Types of Insurance to Consider

- **Life insurance:** Protects dependents if your income stops.  
- **Disability insurance:** Replaces 60–70% of income if illness or injury prevents work.  
- **Critical illness insurance:** Lump sum payment if diagnosed with a serious condition (cancer, stroke, heart attack).  
- **Mortgage insurance vs. life insurance:** Independent life insurance usually offers more flexibility and value than lender-provided mortgage insurance.  
- **Health & dental coverage:** Especially important for self-employed or those without employer benefits.  

---

## How Much Coverage Is Enough?

- **Life insurance:** Rule of thumb = 10–12 times annual income.  
- **Disability insurance:** Aim to cover 60–70% of income.  
- Tailor coverage to your **debts, dependents, and lifestyle goals**.  
- Review policies after major life changes (marriage, children, new mortgage).  

---

## Cost vs. Value

- Insurance isn’t about the price — it’s about **what it protects**.  
- Holistic view: choose coverage that brings calm and security, not unnecessary fear.  
- Avoid over-insuring; align with your real needs and resources.  

---

## The Holistic & Emotional Lens

Protection planning isn’t about expecting the worst — it’s about creating **peace of mind**.  

- Ask: *“Will this bring freedom and calm, or stress and pressure?”*  
- Insurance should be part of a balanced financial plan, not a burden.  
- 💡 *Optional Human Design insight:* If you have **Emotional Authority**, don’t buy insurance on the spot — wait for clarity before signing.

## ✅ Quick Protection Checklist

- [ ] Life insurance in place if you have dependents  
- [ ] Disability coverage through employer or private plan  
- [ ] Critical illness protection if family health history suggests risk  
- [ ] Independent life coverage instead of lender’s mortgage insurance
