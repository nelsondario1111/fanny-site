Retirement isn’t just about stopping work — it’s about building a life of **security, freedom, and wellbeing**. In 2025, Canadians face longer lifespans, rising costs, and more choices than ever. That’s why retirement planning requires more than math — it calls for strategy, clarity, and alignment with your values.  

As a **Holistic Financial Coach and Mortgage Agent Level 2** in Toronto, I help families, professionals, and entrepreneurs design retirement plans that integrate finances, lifestyle, and peace of mind. Here’s how to begin.

## Rethinking Retirement in 2025

- Canadians are living 25–30 years beyond retirement age.  
- Traditional pensions are less common; most households rely on **personal planning**.  
- Holistic planning asks: **What do you want your days to look like? Who do you want to spend them with?**  

---

## Core Financial Foundations

- **RRSPs & RRIFs** — grow tax-deferred; mandatory withdrawals after age 71.  
- **TFSAs** — flexible, tax-free withdrawals for all stages.  
- **CPP & OAS** — understand eligibility, timing, and clawbacks.  
- **Employer pensions** — integrate into your bigger plan.  

💡 Coordinate all sources to avoid surprises and maximize tax efficiency.

## Real Estate & Retirement

- **Downsizing:** free up cash and simplify life.  
- **Rental income:** a well-managed multiplex can create steady monthly cash flow.  
- **Reverse mortgages:** an option for those with high equity, low income.  
- **Renting in retirement:** sometimes less stress than owning.  

---

## Tax-Efficient Withdrawals

- Withdraw in the right order: **RRSP → TFSA → non-registered** (general rule, personalize for your situation).  
- **Split pension income** with your spouse to reduce taxes.  
- Use **charitable giving** (including in-kind securities) to offset taxes while making an impact.  

---

## Entrepreneurs & Self-Employed

- **Incorporation:** tax deferral and flexibility in paying yourself.  
- **Investments inside a corporation:** build long-term assets tax efficiently.  
- Retirement without a pension is possible with the right systems and reserves.  

---

## The Holistic & Emotional Lens

Retirement planning isn’t only numbers:  

- How will you spend your time?  
- How will you nurture health, community, and purpose?  
- What does **freedom** look like for your family?  

💡 *Optional Human Design insight:* Emotional Authority → pause before downsizing or drawing pensions; clarity comes after time.
