I’m Fanny — a heart-centered financial coach and licensed Mortgage Agent (Level 2) in Toronto. If you’re self-employed (consultant, wellness practitioner, creative, tradesperson, or entrepreneur), taxes can feel overwhelming. With the right systems, habits, and clarity, tax season becomes calm and predictable.

## Quick Snapshot: What “Good” Looks Like

- Three accounts: Income → Operating → Tax Reserve (automated transfers)
- One tracker: income, invoices, receipts, mileage (update weekly 10–15 min)
- Monthly: reconcile bank/credit, label expenses, top up Tax Reserve
- Quarterly: review profit, file HST (if registered), adjust pricing
- Year-end: clean receipts, check RRSP/TFSA, deliver a neat package to your tax pro

## 1) Set Up Your Core System (30–60 Minutes)

Three accounts: Income (deposits only), Operating (spending), Tax Reserve (no card). Automation: move 25–30% of every deposit into Tax Reserve; pay yourself on a schedule; transfer operating costs.

Weekly 15 minutes: enter payments, snap receipts, tag categories, record mileage, glance at Tax Reserve.

## 2) What to Track (Simplify)

Income (date, client, invoice #, amount), expenses (vendor, category, amount, receipt link), home office (sq ft %, rent/mortgage interest, utilities, internet), vehicle (business km vs total), HST/GST (collected vs paid), CRA notices, bank/credit statements, contracts.

Suggested folders:
Taxes-2025/
01-Income
02-Expenses
03-Home-Office
04-Vehicle
05-HST
06-CRA-Notices
07-To-Accountant



## 3) Deductions You Can Claim

Home office %, phone/internet/software/subscriptions, marketing (design, ads, coaching), equipment & tools, supplies, payment fees, professional fees, business insurance, travel & meals (limits apply), vehicle (lease/CCA etc. prorated by km). Keep business and personal separate.

## 4) HST / GST — When to Register

Mandatory when taxable revenue exceeds $30,000 in a single quarter or 4 consecutive quarters. Optional early registration can unlock input tax credits. If registered: add 13% (Ontario) to invoices, track collected vs paid, file and remit on time, and park HST in your Tax Reserve.

## 5) How Much to Set Aside for Taxes

25–30% of net income is a safe baseline. Factor in CPP (both halves). CRA may require quarterly installments — normal. Keep Tax Reserve in high-interest savings with automatic transfers.

## 6) Sole Prop vs. Incorporation

Consider incorporation when you earn more than you need personally (retain earnings), want liability protections, or client contracts require it. Decide after a calm numbers review.

## 7) Year-End Checklist

Reconcile statements, ensure receipts are stored, update home office % and vehicle log, confirm RRSP/TFSA/FHSA contributions, pull outstanding invoices/WIP, deliver one clean “To-Accountant” folder.

## 8) Common CRA Letters (Don’t Panic)

Installment reminders (schedule), pre-assessment review (reply with neat PDF), HST notice (file & pay).

Reply script:
> “Please find attached the requested receipts/statements for period __ to __. Totals reconcile to filed return. Let me know if further clarification is needed.”

## 9) Your Quarterly Rhythm

Jan–Mar: new tracker, automate transfers, check TFSA room.  
Apr–Jun: HST filing, pricing review, cash-flow check.  
Jul–Sep: adjust set-aside % if income shifts; mid-year tidy.  
Oct–Dec: year-end planning (RRSPs, investments, equipment), prep accountant package.
