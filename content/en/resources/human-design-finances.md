Most people make financial decisions under pressure — buying quickly, refinancing in a rush, or investing out of fear. Later, they feel regret, stress, or doubt.  

What if you had a **personal roadmap** for how to make decisions calmly and confidently? That’s what **Human Design** offers.  

As a **Holistic Financial Coach and Mortgage Agent Level 2**, I integrate Human Design into financial planning, so money choices feel aligned with both your numbers and your natural energy.

## What Is Human Design?

Human Design is a self-awareness system that blends **ancient wisdom and modern science** — including astrology, chakras, the I Ching, and quantum physics.  

Think of it as a **user manual for your energy**:  
- How you process information.  
- How you make decisions.  
- How to align with your natural strengths.  

It’s not about boxes or restrictions — it’s about clarity and flow.

## The Basics of Human Design

- **Types:** Generator, Manifestor, Projector, Reflector — each has a natural way of using energy.  
- **Strategy:** How to best engage with life (e.g., Generators “respond,” Projectors “wait for invitation”).  
- **Authority:** Your inner compass for decision-making:  
  - **Emotional:** clarity after a full emotional cycle.  
  - **Splenic:** instant intuition in the moment.  
  - **Sacral:** gut “yes/no” responses.  
- **Profiles:** How you learn, grow, and interact with others.

## Why This Matters in Finances

Money decisions can trigger stress. Human Design helps by showing you **how you’re built to decide**.  

- **Emotional Authority:** Don’t rush a mortgage renewal — clarity comes after time.  
- **Splenic Authority:** Trust intuitive nudges when considering opportunities.  
- **Generators/Manifesting Generators:** Don’t force — wait to respond to what shows up.  
- **Projectors:** Avoid burnout by waiting for invitations and recognition.

## Practical Applications With Clients
