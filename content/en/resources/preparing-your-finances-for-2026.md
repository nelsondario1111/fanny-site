As 2025 winds down, many Canadians are asking: **“What should I do before December 31 to set myself up for 2026?”**  

The good news: there are clear, high-impact steps that can reduce taxes, strengthen your cash flow, and bring peace of mind.  

Here’s a professional, heart-centered checklist — designed for families, professionals, and investors in Toronto — to finish the year with clarity and confidence.  

---

## 1. Maximize Your Registered Accounts

- **RRSP:** Contributions made before Feb 28, 2026, can reduce your 2025 taxes.  
- **TFSA:** 2025 annual limit is $7,000; unused room carries forward.  
- **FHSA:** If you qualify, contributions lower taxable income and grow tax-free.  
- **RESP:** Contribute before Dec 31 to secure this year’s CESG government match.  

✨ *Pro tip:* Higher-income households may benefit from **spousal RRSPs** or strategic **income-splitting**.  

---

## 2. Review Your Cash Flow and Reserves

- Ensure you have **1–3 months of essentials** saved.  
- Revisit your **money buckets** (Essentials / Goals / Joy / Future).  
- Redirect bonuses or surplus income into *Goals* (debt payoff, investments, reserves).  
- Use the **Holistic Budget Calculator** → [/en/tools](/en/tools).  

---

## 3. Optimize Debt & Mortgages

- Review **balances, interest rates, and renewal dates**.  
- If your renewal is in 2026, plan early.  
- Explore **prepayments** if cash flow allows.  
- Consider **refinance or consolidation** if it aligns with your long-term wealth plan.  

👉 I can model different renewal and refinance scenarios with you.

## 4. Small Business & Self-Employed: Lock In Deductions

- Buy equipment, software, or training before Dec 31 to deduct in 2025.  
- Track **home office, vehicle, software, and insurance expenses**.  
- Review **HST filing status**.  
- Consider whether **2026 is the right year to incorporate**.  

---

## 5. Tax-Smart Giving

- Donate before Dec 31 to claim **2025 credits**.  
- Consider **in-kind securities donations** to reduce capital gains.  
- Align giving with your **family’s impact vision**.  

---

## 6. Plan for Life Transitions in 2026

Upcoming **property moves, business launches, family changes, inheritances, or retirement milestones** all have tax and cash-flow implications. Planning ahead reduces stress and creates better outcomes.  

---

## 7. Emotional & Holistic Reset

- Reflect on your **top 3 financial wins** of 2025.  
- Release **one money belief** that no longer serves you.  
- Set a **family money intention** for 2026.  

(💡 *Optional HD insight:* If you have **Emotional Authority**, give yourself time — sleep on big year-end decisions before acting.)
