Many adults feel financial stress because they were never taught how to manage money. By starting early, you can give your children the confidence, clarity, and calm relationship with money that most of us wish we had growing up.  

As a **Holistic Financial Coach and Mortgage Agent Level 2** in Toronto, I help families teach financial skills in a way that blends numbers with values, habits, and wellbeing. Here‚Äôs how you can raise financially confident kids.

## Why Kids Need Financial Confidence

- Money literacy isn‚Äôt taught well in schools.  
- Kids learn most from **what we model, not just what we say**.  
- Early lessons build long-term habits and reduce future stress.  

---

## Step 1: Start Small With Everyday Lessons

- Give an allowance connected to **age-appropriate responsibility**.  
- Teach kids to divide money into three simple buckets:  
  - **Spend** (fun today)  
  - **Save** (goals)  
  - **Share** (giving)  
- Involve them in small budgeting decisions, like choosing groceries within a budget.  

---

## Step 2: Use Practical Tools

- Open a **youth savings account**.  
- Track savings visually (jars, apps, or charts).  
- Show interest growth over time in a simple way.  

---

## Step 3: Investing in Their Future

- **RESPs**: Contributions unlock government matching (up to 20% per year).  
- Teach them the concept of **money growing over time** with patience.  
- Introduce opportunity cost: choosing between two good things teaches trade-offs.  

---

## Step 4: Values & the Holistic Lens

- Teach mindful spending: ask, *‚ÄúDoes this bring joy or add clutter?‚Äù*  
- Show that money is for **experiences, security, and impact**, not just things.  
- üí° *Optional Human Design insight:* Encourage kids to listen to their natural decision-making style ‚Äî it helps them trust themselves financially later in life.  

---

## Step 5: Make It a Family Practice

- Hold **monthly family money conversations** ‚Äî include kids at their level.  
- Celebrate milestones, like reaching a savings goal.  
- Normalize mistakes: use them as learning opportunities, not shame.

- [ ] Open a youth savings account + RESP
