![Rental Property and Taxes: What First-Time Landlords Need to Know in Ontario](/Rental-Property-and-Taxes.png)


Becoming a landlord is an exciting step — especially when your rental property is also part of your wealth-building strategy. But many first-time landlords in Ontario aren’t fully prepared for the tax side of real estate investing.

As both a financial coach and licensed mortgage agent, I specialize in helping clients approach their investments holistically — blending clear financial guidance with practical planning, peace of mind, and long-term success.

If you’ve just purchased (or are about to purchase) your first rental property, this guide will help you understand how to handle the taxes — the smart, sustainable way.

## 🎯 First, Know What Counts as Rental Income

In Canada, any money you earn from renting out a property — whether it’s a basement suite, a fourplex, or a vacation rental — is considered rental income and must be reported to the CRA.

That includes:

- Monthly rent collected from tenants
- Payments for utilities (if paid by the tenant to you)
- Parking fees or laundry revenue
- Rent paid in advance or security deposits (if you keep any portion)

💡 *Tip: Keep a simple log or spreadsheet of all rental-related payments and income — ideally updated monthly.*

## 🧾 What Expenses Can You Deduct?

This is where things get exciting — and where many landlords miss out.

You can deduct reasonable expenses that relate directly to earning rental income. That includes:

✅ Mortgage interest (not the principal portion)  
✅ Property taxes and insurance  
✅ Repairs and maintenance  
✅ Utilities (if paid by you)  
✅ Condo fees  
✅ Advertising for new tenants  
✅ Accounting or property management fees  
✅ Travel expenses for property visits (within reason)

If you're renting out part of your principal residence (like a basement apartment), you’ll need to divide shared expenses (such as heat or internet) based on the percentage of the home used for rental purposes.

## 🔧 Repairs vs. Capital Improvements: What’s the Difference?

Not all expenses are treated equally. The CRA distinguishes between:

- **Current repairs:** Minor, routine fixes like painting, broken light switches, or appliance replacements — usually deductible in full the same year.
- **Capital improvements:** Major upgrades that increase the value of the property (like adding a new bathroom or replacing a roof) — these must be deducted gradually over time as "capital cost allowance" (CCA).

💡 *Tip: Always keep receipts and records, and label each upgrade as a repair or capital improvement from the start.*

## 📉 Can You Claim Depreciation (CCA)?

Yes — but with caution.

CCA allows you to deduct a portion of the building’s value each year to account for wear and tear. However, if you sell the property in the future, you may face a recapture of that depreciation, meaning you’ll have to pay some of it back as taxable income.

For this reason, I usually recommend:

- First-time landlords don’t claim CCA until they’ve spoken with a financial coach or accountant
- Focus on maximizing current expenses and using CCA only if you have rental losses to offset

## 📁 Organize for Tax Time All Year Long

Avoid the panic of tax season by creating a simple system from day one:

- One folder for receipts (digital or paper)
- One spreadsheet or app for income and expenses
- A calendar reminder each month to log rent received and any new costs
- Keep a backup of your lease agreements, mortgage statements, and any professional reports

If you co-own the property with a spouse, split the income and expenses based on ownership share.

## 💡 Bonus Tips for Ontario Landlords

- Report your rental income even if you didn’t make a profit — the CRA still requires it.
- Short-term rentals (like Airbnb) may be taxed differently than long-term leases — get advice if this applies to you.
- Newcomers: If this is your first time dealing with Canadian property taxes, don’t worry — I guide many clients through the process in both English and Spanish.
- First-year landlords often benefit from a one-time tax review or planning session to make sure nothing gets missed — this can save you hundreds later.
