Owning a rental property in Ontario is more than collecting rent â€” itâ€™s a wealth strategy that can accelerate freedom when managed with foresight. Yet many first-time landlords underestimate the tax side of the equation, risking unnecessary stress or lost returns.

As both a **Holistic Financial Coach** and **Licensed Mortgage Agent (Level 2)** in Toronto, I work with professionals, families, and investors who want more than compliance â€” they want a strategy that supports their life goals, peace of mind, and legacy.

If youâ€™re preparing to rent out a condo, duplex, or multiplex, hereâ€™s what you need to know to manage taxes like a pro â€” without losing the heart-centered approach that keeps money aligned with your values.

## What Counts as Rental Income in Canada?

Any payment you receive in exchange for the use of your property is taxable rental income. That includes:  
- monthly rent  
- utility reimbursements  
- parking, storage, or laundry fees  
- deposits you keep  

Keep each propertyâ€™s records segmented.

## Deductible Expenses Landlords Should Track

Maximizing allowable expenses is where professionals gain efficiency. Deductible items include:  
- mortgage interest (not principal)  
- property taxes  
- insurance  
- condo/management fees  
- repairs & maintenance  
- utilities you pay  
- advertising, accounting, legal fees  
- reasonable travel for oversight  

ðŸ’¡ If you rent part of your home, apportion shared costs fairly.

## Repairs vs. Capital Improvements

- **Repairs (current expenses):** Painting, fixing plumbing, replacing an appliance. Deductible in full the same year.  
- **Capital improvements:** Renovations that add value or extend life (new kitchen, roof). Deducted over time via Capital Cost Allowance (CCA).  

ðŸ‘‰ Label upgrades correctly from the start; misclassification can be costly.

---

## Depreciation (CCA): Use With Intention

CCA can reduce taxable income, but may trigger **recapture** when you sell.  
- Optimize current expenses first.  
- Use CCA only if it aligns with your **hold period and exit plan**.

## Stay Organized Year-Round

- Cloud folders for leases, receipts, mortgage docs  
- Monthly tracking routine  
- If co-owned, split income/expenses by ownership share  

ðŸ›  Templates at [/en/tools](/en/tools) can help you stay consistent.

## Ontario-Specific Notes for Professionals

- Declare income even if break-even  
- Short-term rentals may involve HST and stricter reporting  
- If investing abroad, coordinate with cross-border advisors  
- High earners may explore holding companies (only if income/goals justify complexity)

## Real Estate as a Holistic Wealth Lever

Your rental affects **cash flow, taxes, and lifestyle**. Thatâ€™s why I combine coaching (values, calm) with technical planning (mortgages, taxes).

## 30-Day Starter Plan for New Landlords

- **Week 1:** Open a separate account for rental income/expenses  
- **Week 2:** Log property details (mortgage, tax, insurance, lease)  
- **Week 3:** Set monthly reminder to update your tracker  
- **Week 4:** Book a tax-planning call (English/Spanish)
