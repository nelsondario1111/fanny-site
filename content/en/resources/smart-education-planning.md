For many Canadian families, one of the biggest dreams ‚Äî and stressors ‚Äî is saving for children‚Äôs education. Tuition and living costs keep rising, and parents want to give their kids opportunities without compromising their own financial wellbeing.  

The good news: with the right strategy, you can fund your child‚Äôs future *and* protect your own goals.  

As a **Holistic Financial Coach and Mortgage Agent Level 2**, I help families plan education savings that feel balanced, intentional, and calm.

## Why Education Planning Matters

- Tuition and living expenses can easily exceed **$60,000‚Äì$80,000** for a 4-year degree.  
- Without a plan, families often sacrifice retirement or take on high-interest loans.  
- With structure, you can create opportunity while keeping your own future secure.

## Step 1: Use the RESP Advantage

The **Registered Education Savings Plan (RESP)** is Canada‚Äôs most powerful tool for education savings.  

- **Tax-deferred growth** ‚Äî investments inside the RESP grow tax-free until withdrawal.  
- **Government grants:**  
  - **Canada Education Savings Grant (CESG):** 20% match up to $500/year ($7,200 lifetime max).  
  - **Canada Learning Bond (CLB):** up to $2,000 for lower-income families, no contributions required.  

üí° Even if you can‚Äôt maximize contributions, small deposits still grow with government top-ups.  

---

## Step 2: How Much to Save

- To capture the full CESG, contribute **$2,500/year per child**.  
- Even $50‚Äì$100/month makes a difference over time.  
- Start early: the earlier contributions begin, the longer compounding has to work.  

---

## Step 3: Balance With Parental Needs

- Don‚Äôt sacrifice **retirement savings** for education.  
- Kids can borrow for school ‚Äî parents cannot borrow for retirement.  
- A healthy balance protects both generations.  

---

## Step 4: Beyond RESPs

- **TFSA:** Flexible for education, home, or other family goals.  
- **Family contributions:** Grandparents and relatives can contribute to a child‚Äôs RESP.  
- **Scholarships & bursaries:** Encourage kids to apply ‚Äî billions go unclaimed yearly.  
- **Part-time work:** Builds responsibility and reduces reliance on loans.

## Step 5: Holistic & Emotional Lens

Education planning is about more than money:  

- It‚Äôs about supporting your child‚Äôs unique path and passions.  
- Avoid pressure: the ‚Äúbest‚Äù school is the one aligned with their goals.  
- üí° *Human Design insight:* Consider your child‚Äôs natural learning and decision-making style when discussing education choices.
