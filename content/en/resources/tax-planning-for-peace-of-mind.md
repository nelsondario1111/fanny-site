![Tax Planning for Peace of Mind](/Tax-Planning.png)

Tax season often brings a wave of stress — receipts everywhere, unexpected bills, and that sinking feeling of “I should’ve planned better.”  
But what if your relationship with taxes could feel different?

As a holistic financial coach and a former tax auditor, I believe tax planning doesn’t have to be overwhelming. In fact, it can be grounding, empowering — even calming. Whether you're employed, self-employed, or somewhere in between, year-round tax planning is one of the most underrated tools to reduce stress and build long-term peace of mind.

Here’s how to approach your taxes with clarity, confidence, and care.

## Why “Holistic” Tax Planning?

Traditional tax advice often focuses only on deductions and deadlines. Holistic tax planning goes deeper. It asks:

- What are your life goals, and how can your tax strategy support them?
- Are your habits and systems making taxes easier — or harder?
- How does your emotional relationship with money show up during tax time?

When you take a holistic approach, taxes become part of your overall wellbeing — not just a once-a-year chore.

## 1. Create a Calm, Monthly Tax Check-In

Rather than cramming everything into April, break tax prep into small, manageable pieces.

**🗓️ Once a month, schedule 30 minutes for a “tax check-in.”**  
What to do:

- Categorize receipts or upload them to a folder (physical or digital)
- Review any business or rental income received
- Note any major expenses that might be deductible (home office, car use, medical)
- Track RRSP or TFSA contributions
- Ask: “What changed this month that might affect my taxes?”

💡 *Tip: Pair this check-in with something calming — a cup of tea, music, or a journal — to make it feel like a routine, not a task.*

## 2. Understand What You Can Deduct

The Canadian tax system offers many credits and deductions — but most people don’t know what they’re eligible for. Here are a few holistic categories to explore:

**🧘 Wellness & Health:**
- Out-of-pocket medical expenses
- Therapy, counseling, or alternative healing (when approved by CRA)

**💼 Business or Side Hustle:**
- Home office percentage
- Equipment, supplies, software
- Internet or phone used for work
- Transportation and client-related meals

**🏠 Home & Real Estate:**
- Rental property repairs and interest
- Property taxes and insurance (for income-producing units)
- Co-ownership with a spouse or relative — plan who claims what

**🎓 Family & Growth:**
- Tuition and education credits
- Childcare expenses
- Contributions to RESP or RDSP (and the government grants they trigger!)

## 3. Plan for Life Transitions

Your tax situation changes as your life evolves. Planning for these shifts in advance can save stress — and money.

Key transitions to prepare for:

- Starting a family
- Changing jobs or becoming self-employed
- Buying a property (personal or rental)
- Receiving an inheritance
- Retirement planning or withdrawing RRSPs

A holistic advisor looks at the whole picture — your finances, your family, and your future. I help you make tax-aligned choices that support your bigger life goals.

## 4. Keep it Simple, Organized, and Bilingual (if needed)

Many of my clients are bilingual or immigrants navigating Canadian taxes for the first time.  
I make sure everything is explained in plain English or Spanish, so you feel truly informed and empowered.

**Tools I recommend:**
- A simple tax folder (labeled by month or category)
- A digital drive (Google Drive or Dropbox) for uploading receipts & PDFs
- A shared checklist for couples to track joint expenses and who’s claiming what
- WhatsApp or voice-note summaries for easy communication on the go

---

## 5. Ask for Help Before It’s Urgent

Most tax stress happens when we wait until the last minute. But when you reach out earlier — in the fall, or even the summer — we can explore:

- Strategies to reduce next year’s taxes
- Ways to pay less without red flags
- Setting up installments if you owe
- Creating a smoother filing process with no surprises

Working with a coach means you don’t have to figure it all out alone.
