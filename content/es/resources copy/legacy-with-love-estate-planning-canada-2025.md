Estate planning isn’t only about documents and taxes — it’s about **love, clarity, and leaving peace of mind for your family**. Yet many Canadians avoid the conversation, leaving their loved ones vulnerable to stress, conflict, and unnecessary costs.  

As a **Holistic Financial Coach and Mortgage Agent Level 2** in Toronto, I help families prepare not only financially, but also emotionally, for the legacy they want to leave. Here’s how to start.

## Why Legacy Planning Matters

- Without a plan, the government decides how assets are distributed.  
- Delays, family conflict, and higher taxes are common.  
- With a plan: your wishes are respected, taxes are reduced, and your family feels guided.  

---

## The Core Documents

1. **Will** — Outlines how your assets are distributed and who manages your estate.  
2. **Power of Attorney (POA):**  
   - **Financial POA:** Someone you trust manages finances if you cannot.  
   - **Personal Care POA:** Decisions about health and daily care.  
3. **Beneficiary Designations:** Ensure RRSPs, TFSAs, pensions, and life insurance policies name the right people.  

---

## Taxes & Estate Costs

- **RRSPs/RRIFs:** Taxed as income on death unless transferred to a spouse or dependent.  
- **Capital gains:** On real estate (except principal residence) and investments.  
- **Probate fees in Ontario:** Approx. 1.5% of estate value.  

💡 With planning, you can reduce taxes, maximize what’s left for family, and avoid unnecessary delays.

## Beyond Money: A Holistic Legacy

Your legacy is more than numbers. It’s also about the values and wisdom you pass on.  

- Write a **“family letter”** with your hopes, lessons, and wishes.  
- Share guidance for future generations.  
- Consider **charitable giving** (e.g., donating securities, setting up a foundation) to extend impact beyond your family.

## Case Study

- **With a will + updated POAs + beneficiary designations:** Smooth transition, lower taxes, family supported with clarity and love.
