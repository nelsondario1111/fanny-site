In Toronto‚Äôs housing market, one of the biggest financial questions is: **‚ÄúShould I keep renting, or is it time to buy?‚Äù**  

The truth: there isn‚Äôt a one-size-fits-all answer. Renting isn‚Äôt ‚Äúthrowing money away,‚Äù and buying isn‚Äôt always ‚Äúbetter.‚Äù The right choice depends on **your numbers, your lifestyle, and your vision for the future**.  

As a **Mortgage Agent Level 2 and Holistic Financial Coach**, I help families and professionals make this decision with clarity, confidence, and peace of mind.

## Renting: Pros & Cons

**Pros**  
- Flexibility to move without selling.  
- Lower upfront costs (no down payment or closing costs).  
- No property tax, major repairs, or maintenance bills.  

**Cons**  
- No equity growth over time.  
- Rent may increase at renewal.  
- Less control over your home (landlord decisions, rules).  

---

## Buying: Pros & Cons

**Pros**  
- Build equity as you pay down the mortgage.  
- Stability and long-term security.  
- Ability to customize or rent part of the property (duplex, basement, multiplex).  

**Cons**  
- High upfront costs (down payment, closing, land transfer tax).  
- Ongoing expenses: property taxes, insurance, maintenance, repairs.  
- Less flexibility if you need to move quickly.

## The Math: Rent vs. Buy Calculator

The numbers matter ‚Äî but they‚Äôre not the whole story.  

- Compare **monthly rent vs. mortgage payments** (including taxes, insurance, condo fees).  
- Factor in **upfront costs**: down payment + closing.  
- Consider the **opportunity cost**: what if you kept renting and invested the difference?  

üõ† Use the **Rent vs. Buy Calculator** at [/en/tools](/es/herramientas) to run your own scenarios.

## Holistic Factors Beyond the Math

- **Lifestyle:** Do you value flexibility or stability?  
- **Stress:** Will owning stretch your nervous system or create peace?  
- **Family stage:** Kids, retirement, newcomers, or career transitions.  
- **Values:** Do you want roots in a community, or freedom to move?  

üí° *Human Design insight:* If you have **Emotional Authority**, sleep on major housing decisions ‚Äî clarity comes after time, not pressure.

## Case Study: Toronto Family Example

- Renting: $3,200/month for a downtown condo.  
- Buying: $750,000 condo with 20% down ($150,000).  
  - Mortgage + tax + condo fees ‚âà $4,200/month.  
  - Plus upfront $150,000 down payment + $20,000+ in closing costs.  

**Trade-off:** Renting preserves cash flow for travel, RESP, and flexibility. Buying builds equity but requires higher monthly outflow and commitment.
