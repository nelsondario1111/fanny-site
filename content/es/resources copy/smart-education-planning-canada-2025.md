For many Canadian families, one of the biggest dreams — and stressors — is saving for children’s education. Tuition and living costs keep rising, and parents want to give their kids opportunities without compromising their own financial wellbeing.  

The good news: with the right strategy, you can fund your child’s future *and* protect your own goals.  

As a **Holistic Financial Coach and Mortgage Agent Level 2**, I help families plan education savings that feel balanced, intentional, and calm.

## Why Education Planning Matters

- Tuition and living expenses can easily exceed **$60,000–$80,000** for a 4-year degree.  
- Without a plan, families often sacrifice retirement or take on high-interest loans.  
- With structure, you can create opportunity while keeping your own future secure.

## Step 1: Use the RESP Advantage

The **Registered Education Savings Plan (RESP)** is Canada’s most powerful tool for education savings.  

- **Tax-deferred growth** — investments inside the RESP grow tax-free until withdrawal.  
- **Government grants:**  
  - **Canada Education Savings Grant (CESG):** 20% match up to $500/year ($7,200 lifetime max).  
  - **Canada Learning Bond (CLB):** up to $2,000 for lower-income families, no contributions required.  

💡 Even if you can’t maximize contributions, small deposits still grow with government top-ups.  

---

## Step 2: How Much to Save

- To capture the full CESG, contribute **$2,500/year per child**.  
- Even $50–$100/month makes a difference over time.  
- Start early: the earlier contributions begin, the longer compounding has to work.  

---

## Step 3: Balance With Parental Needs

- Don’t sacrifice **retirement savings** for education.  
- Kids can borrow for school — parents cannot borrow for retirement.  
- A healthy balance protects both generations.  

---

## Step 4: Beyond RESPs

- **TFSA:** Flexible for education, home, or other family goals.  
- **Family contributions:** Grandparents and relatives can contribute to a child’s RESP.  
- **Scholarships & bursaries:** Encourage kids to apply — billions go unclaimed yearly.  
- **Part-time work:** Builds responsibility and reduces reliance on loans.  

---

## Step 5: Holistic & Emotional Lens

Education planning is about more than money:  

- It’s about supporting your child’s unique path and passions.  
- Avoid pressure: the “best” school is the one aligned with their goals.  
- 💡 *Human Design insight:* Consider your child’s natural learning and decision-making style when discussing education choices.
